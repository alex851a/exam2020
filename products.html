Manifold Architecture
Manifold does projects and concepts for all sorts of spaces and structures from town-scale to single rooms.
Using and arhcitect means quality and unique experiences for the clients, which should be important parameters when using large amounts of ressources. The aim of Manifold is to make not only beautiful and interesting projects, but also processes where all parts have fun. Hence, part of a project is the project design.
Manifold Architecture builds on the following values:

Sustainability - financially, technically, socially, and as a whole. The style of Manifold reflects the will to use the ressources on the real qualities and good, lasting stories.
Edge - the intent to puish concepts to an extreme degree and not be afraid of doing something special.
Exploration - openess towards unexpected possibilities and parameters.
Joy - the intent of creating daily happiness and well-being for users and client, in process and in product.


Manifold Design
The design-part of the Manifold office is currently mostly experimental and as such just a source of inspiration and exploration for the dominant architecture part. The focus is mainly on cheap ways of getting to nice effects fpr example using waste material in new connection.
Offers:
Interior concepts
From wild ideas to help with placement of furnitures.
Lightning concepts
Focus on the light effect rather than the shape of the armature
